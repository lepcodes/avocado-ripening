A Deep Learning project for predicting the ripening of avocado images.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for development, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t avocado-ripening-api .
```

and then run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To build the Docker image for production, run the following command:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t lepcodes/avocado-ripening-api:latest --push .
```


## Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 avocado-ripening
```

This will start the container and map port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host machine.
